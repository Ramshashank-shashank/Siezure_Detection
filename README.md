This project aims to build a seizure detection system using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to analyze EEG data and classify it into multiple categories. The model captures temporal dependencies in EEG signals to improve detection accuracy, making it a potentially valuable tool for healthcare providers.I achieved a accuracy of 93% for 5-Class Classification
